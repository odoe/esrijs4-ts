# ArcGIS API 4.0 TypeScript Testing

This repo is just a way to test out the [TypeScript Definition Files for 4.0](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/tree/master/4.x/typescript).

This includes manually creating the `tsconfig.json` to update with new TypeScript files added.
It also uses `grunt` to watch for changes and compile as needed.
